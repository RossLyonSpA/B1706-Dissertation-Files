The serve is widely regarded as a critical shot in modern tennis, providing the server with a 
considerable advantage over their opponent. As a result, the majority of service games are won 
by the server. The advantage of serving is further amplified on grass courts, where the low 
bounce and fast surface speed increase the effectiveness of the serve. Consequently, dominant 
serving, where the server does not exhibit performance patterns associated with breaks of 
serve, is proposed to contribute significantly to the outcome of grass court tennis matches. 

This research study examines the influence of serving performance on the outcome of service 
games in elite professional men’s tennis. Utilising a case study approach, the study’s objective 
is to evaluate whether diverging match outcomes can be explained by differences in serving 
performance. A secondary objective is to identify which serving metrics are most influential in 
classifying the outcome of a service game.  

The study leverages the machine learning algorithm “eXtreme Gradient Boosting” to classify 
service game outcomes using a variety of server performance metrics. A quantitative dataset 
serves as the primary data source for the model, containing data from matches played at 
Wimbledon 2010, 2011 and 2012. The study tests the hypothesis that service game 
classification errors can identify the statistical under- or over-performance of a server in service 
games throughout a match; illustrating a server’s perceived dominance on serve.  

The model achieved a high level of classification accuracy, suggesting that serving performance 
is a strong predictor of service game outcomes. Classification errors demonstrated an 
association between serving dominance and match outcome. Short term server momentum is 
found to influence service game outcomes, while servers who win a high percentage of short 
rallies on first serve also increase their likelihood of holding serve. Server performance on 
critical points – such as Game and Break Points – is also identified as a strong predictor of 
service game outcome.
